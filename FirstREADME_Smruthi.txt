I have joined the new project team few days ago. This is my current status:

1.Have taken up on figleaf task and understood its basics and what it does.
2.Have prepared my development setup (installing python, figleaf).
3.Currently working on executing the test cases as coverage.py was executed and tested. 
4.Since the project is in Python I am trying to familiarize myself with it by going through online tutorials.
